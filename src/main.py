"""
The issue with using MuseScore4 midi files in FL Studio is that they are
not compatible with FL Studio because FL Studio does not use the first track
for storing or reading note data; whereas, MuseScore4 does. This converter
will convert the MuseScore4 midi file to a format that is compatible with FL Studio.
To do this, the converter will take the first track of the MuseScore4 midi file
and move all the notes held within it to the second track of the MuseScore4 midi file
so that the first track only contains the necessary data matching how FL Studio
expects the data to be.
